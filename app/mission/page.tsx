        <p className="text-lg">
          At Dublin Sports Mentor, we believe that sports should be accessible to everyone, regardless of age,
          background, or experience level. Our approach is centered around creating a supportive, inclusive environment
          where individuals can discover and develop their athletic potential.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Community Impact</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Beyond individual coaching, we're committed to making a positive impact on the Dublin community as a whole. By
          introducing more people to sports, we're helping to create a healthier, more connected city where people come
          together through shared activities and experiences.
